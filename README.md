## Installation

Python 3.8 or higher is required. Just use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) to install:

```shell
python3 -m pip install pyceps
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and add a CLI entry point.
To test the installation run

```shell
pyceps --help
```

## Standard Workflow
Typically, a user wants to import and translate complete EAM data sets, save
a reduced version of the data set to disk, and visualize the data.
```shell
pyceps --system "carto" --study-repository "path_to_repository" --convert --visualize --save-study
pyceps --system "precision" --study-repository "path_to_repository" --convert --visualize --save-study
```
*--system* specifies the EAM system used for data acquisition.<br>
*--study-repository* points to a (valid) data location, e.g. a ZIP archive
(preferred), or a folder.<br>
*--convert* automatically loads the data set in its entirety and exports all
data to openCARP compatible formats.<br>
*--visualize* opens a local HTML site and interactively shows the EAM data.<br>
*--save-study* saves the (reduced) EAM data set to disk as .pyceps file, which 
can be used later (much faster than re-importing the EAM data).
 
To open and work with a previously generated .pyceps file use
```shell
pyceps --study-file "path_to_file" --visualize ...
pyceps --study-file "path_to_file" --visualize ...
```

### Quick preview of studies
EAM data sets can be quickly visualized to preview anatomical shells, recording 
point locations, and ablation lesions:
```shell
pyceps --system "carto" --study-repository "path_to_repository" --quick
```
> Note: Any other input/output arguments will be ignored!

## Saving a reduced version of EAM data
Upon import of EAM data, a data representation is built which can be saved to
disk for later usage.
This data object does not contain the entirety of data available in the EAM
data set (e.g. not all ECG and EGM data is read) but can therefore be loaded
very quickly.
To save the data representation in .pyceps format to disk use
```shell
--save-study
```
The file is automatically saved in the folder above the repository path
(if EAM data resides in a folder), or in the same folder if data is imported
from ZIP archives.
Optionally, a different location can be given.

By default, any ECG data associated with recording points is not saved in the 
output file.
If you wish to save ECG data as well for later usage and/or visualization you 
can add the option
```shell
--keep-ecg
```
> Note: files will grow drastically in size if many recording points are present

## Visualizing the data
Once a data set was imported/loaded it can be visualized using a local HTML
site to evaluate the quality of the data set:
```shell
--visualize
```
> Note: This will lock the console!

## Advanced Import/Export
To control which data, i.e. mapping procedures, are imported from an EAM data
set and which data are exported, the commands described below can be chained
together.
It is also possible to add data to an existing .pyceps file at a later point,
if the study repository (original data) is still accessible. See usage of
*--change-root* for details on how to change data location if needed.

### Specifying the EAM system
```shell
--system [carto, precision]
```
This is used only when importing data from an EAM data repository.

### Specifying the data location
```shell
--study-repository "path_to_repository"
--study-file "path_to_file"
```
Using these commands will gather basic information from the data set,
(i.e. name of the study, performed mapping procedures, etc.) and display this
information on the command line.

### Specifying what to import
To import single mapping procedures the name of the mapping procedure can be
specified. Optional *all* can be used to import all mapping procedures (same as
using *--convert*). 
```shell
pyceps.py ... --import-map "map_name"
pyceps.py ... --import-map "all"
```
All information related to the mapping procedure is loaded, i.e.
anatomical shell, mapping points, ablation lesions, etc.

### Specifying what to export
It is possible to export specific items from the data set.
This works only for single mapping procedures, therefore a mapping procedure
to work with has to be specified first using
```shell
--map "map_name"
```
All following commands are then applied to this mapping procedure only.

```shell
--dump-mesh
--dump-point-data
--dump-point-egms
--dump-point-ecgs
--dump-map-ecgs
--dump-surface-maps
--dump-lesions
```

> Note: If *--convert* is used, this is obsolete since data is exported for all
> mapping procedures.

> Note: Using *--dump-point-ecgs* needs access to EAM data repository to load
> ECG data!<br>
> See below how to set a valid path if necessary

### Changing the location of original EAM data
When opening EAM data from previously generated .pyceps files, the original EAM
data set might not be accessible or the path might have changed (e.g. when
using mounted devices).
Information if the path stored in the .pyceps file is still valid is displayed 
upon loading of a .pyceps file.
To change the path to an EAM data repository use
```shell
--change-root "path_to_repository"
```
This will check if the new path is valid and set it accordingly.

## For Experts

The data contained in exported data sets differs for different mapping systems.
Exporting data via the CLI accesses only data common to every mapping system.
To access the entirety of imported data, Python scripts have to be used.

```python
from pyceps import CartoStudy

study = CartoStudy("path_to_repository",
                   pwd='password',
                   encoding='encoding')
study.import_study()
# import all available maps
study.import_maps(study.mapNames)
...
```
